To use online features such as saving, you need to [register an account](https://powdertoy.co.uk/Register.html).
You can also visit [the official TPT forum](https://powdertoy.co.uk/Discussions/Categories/Index.html).

Have you ever wanted to mess with elements like honey, vinegar, baking soda, mud, blood, and more? The Elements & UI Plus lets you do all of these and more! I also modified the appearance.cpp file to improve the UI, making the game look better than ever before. However there are a lot of bugs and i haven't fixed it cuz of me being lazy af.

Screenshot of updated UI:

The Powder Toy is a free physics sandbox game, which simulates air pressure and velocity, heat, gravity and a countless number of interactions between different substances! The game provides you with various building materials, liquids, gases and electronic components which can be used to construct complex machines, guns, bombs, realistic terrains and almost anything else. You can then mine them and watch cool explosions, add intricate wirings, play with little stickmen or operate your machine. You can browse and play thousands of different saves made by the community or upload your own – we welcome your creations!

There is a Lua API – you can automate your work or even make plugins for the game. The Powder Toy is free and the source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License, so you can modify the game yourself or help with development.
